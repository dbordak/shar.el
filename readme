Share your current buffer with peeps.

One single command -- shar -- contextually determines the best course
of action. Depending upon the situation, it might:

 - Text/Email a link to Github/Bitbucket pointing to the line you're
   currently at in the file you're currently editing.

 - Text a link to a Gist containing the file you're currently editing,
   generated on-the-spot

 - Email the file you're currently editing as the message body.

Emaily bits use Sendgrid, Texty bits use Twilio.
